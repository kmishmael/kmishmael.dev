# Personal Portofolio

Simple and responsive personal portfolio that showcases one's but not limited to experiences, education, projects, community work, profile and technical stack.

## Developing

This project is created using [`Hugo`](https://gohugo.io/), arguably the fastest static site generator framework. Using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. Also, using [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) to watch and rebuild, and parse style files in development, and also in production.

Clone the project and installed dependencies with

```bash
npm install
```

or `pnpm install` or `yarn`

start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

```

check `package.json` for other available script commands.
