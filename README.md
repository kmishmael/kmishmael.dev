# kmishmael.tech
Personal website that showcases but not limited to experiences, education, projects, and my blog (ranging from software development to personal issues to things I think about before going to bed at night.)

## Developing

This project is created using [`Astro`](https://astro.build/). Using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. Content is stored in markdown files that are parsed for static generation.

Clone the project and installed dependencies with

```bash
npm install
```

or `pnpm install` or `yarn`

start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

```

check `package.json` for other available script commands.
