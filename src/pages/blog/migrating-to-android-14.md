Its been 4 months since I upgraded my phone, finally, from an Infinix Note 4 Pro {link to siliconvoyage here} running Android 7.0 (Nougat) to Samsung M14 5G running Android 14 and Samsung's One UI 6.0 skin. Since that time a lot has changed. First, Google has stopped naming Android version after desert names. I loved those names. I compared them to Intel code names, and how they are a good conversation starter and a big flag for a nerd. Do you know what Alder Lake was? If you do, let's take a second to remember the good times (yes I know it was just a little over 2 year ago).

## What to expect
In this article, I will talk about what I use my smartphone for, justify some use cases, and finally give a unorthodox review on the cheap phone I bought. Finally, I will give my opinion on whether the smarthphone innovation is heading to the right direction and if there is a significant differenced to the seven year old smartphone.
