For some reason, you find yourself browsing on LinkedIn. You find that your friend is happy to announce that he has secured an internship at a prestigous company, or someone has done and finished a certification which you've probably never heard of, or anything else. You try to wish your friend congratulations. However, you find that there is a suggestion there easily comment "Congratulations Ronald". So you click on it, and there you have it, you have commented. Ronald, in this case, will be so happy, and subsequently get a suggestion reply to your post, "Thank You", which he will definately select.

Now, consider a Van Gough painting, or any other great artist. Their art is considered some of the most expensive. This is mostly because of the age of the art, the talent of Van Gough and the labour put into it. The finitie amount of hours Van Gough used to paint it. We can't possibly rule out that is there is another living artist right now, who is as talented as van Gough, puts in even a lot more labour than Van Gough did, and still his painting won;t fetch the same price as a Van Gough painting. Now, what about Mid Journey, it could arguably generate a painting in the level of Van Gough. But appropriately, we recard the painting as almost worthless, it comes as a package which you can subscribe to for $20 a month.

Back to the LinkedIn story, what happens if I am on the receiving end of it, what happens when my post receives the generic response "Congratulations Kibet". Chances are I won't even bother to respond to it. Humans tend to pay attention if they think that someone put so much effort into it. If someone were to responsde "Congratulation, I remember when you began this journey and now finally after 1 year you are done, I'm so proud of you". This response seems so genuine, somone put an effort in writing this and I will be glad to reply to it.

Youtube, arguably the biggest video platform on the planet, introduced shorts. Suddenly there is influx of AI generated voices using what I'm not sure, but might as well be AI generated scripts. People don't jump through this videos. In fact, some of them enjoy them. Just look at any AI generated short of Eminem.
